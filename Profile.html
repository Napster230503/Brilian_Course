                The monitoring post for sacrificial animals in Salatiga City which is open from
                Monday (27/6/2022) there are still no fans. First day no owner
                sacrificial animal who examines his sacrificial animal.
                Head of the Food and Agriculture Service (Dispangtan) of Salatiga City
                Henni Mulyani said the checkpoint was opened in front of Kebun Noborejo,
                which is the entrance to Salatiga City. "Besides the check points, there are also
                livestock traffic control area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The place is located at three points, namely Blotongan,
                Kecandran and Tingkir," he explained. Henni said the examination of the sacrificial animals
                it is free of charge. "Please check here,
                this is free. If the animal is healthy and there is no indication of disease
                mouth and nails (PMK), an animal health certificate will be issued
                (SKKH)," he explained.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is said, the post that was opened at this time was due to time considerations.
                So that if there are animals that are indicated as PMK, they can be handled immediately
                and treated. "There are still about 14 days for treatment.
                So if PMK is indicated, later on Eid al-Adha,
                the sacrificial animals are in good health," said Henni.
                "If we are checked in a short time, we are worried that we will not be healthy
                ahead of Eid al-Adha, and this has an impact on the health conditions of animals and animals
                when slaughtering," he added. Henni added, because it was still quiet
                enthusiasts who check the sacrificial animals, then the Dispangtan of Salatiga City
                move actively to farmers and collectors. "Socialize about check points and
                We will continue to carry out veterinary checks," he said.
